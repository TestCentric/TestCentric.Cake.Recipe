# TestCentric.Cake.Recipe

TestCentric.Cake.Recipe is a standard cake recipe used for TestCentric projects.
It is inspired by Cake.Recipe but is somewhat simpler in implementation, since
it isn't intended for general use.

## Usage

This section is under development. For now, take a look at the `net20-pluggable-agent`
project for an example of how the recipe is used.

## Limitations

The recipe is still under development and initially targets the building, testing
and publishing of pluggable agents. It will be extended for use with other types
of extensions as well as the building of the TestCentric engine and GUI runner.
